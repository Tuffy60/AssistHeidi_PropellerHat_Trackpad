In this folder you can find the design of Touchpad Controller, 
that consists of four distinct printed components:
1)	Inclined Base and Lower Housing (Base_TouchPad.stl)
This part provides the ergonomic tilt and forms the lower shell of the enclosure.
2)	Microcontroller Compartment Lid (MicroController_Lid_TouchPad.stl)
 A removable cover that protects the microcontroller and allows access for wiring and   maintenance.
3)	Main Body with Touchpad Mount and Switch Compartments (Main_TouchPad.stl)  
This central block integrates the mounting surface for the touchpad and the housing for the two auxiliary switches.
4)	Touchpad Outer Frame  (Top_TouchPad.stl)
A protective enclosure that secures the touchpad in place while leaving the active surface fully accessible.
